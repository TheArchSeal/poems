Is this friendship?  
Is this belonging?  

Lacking connection.  
Lacking recognition.  
Without relating.  
Without understanding.  

Conversation.  
Achievable yet impossible.  
Unnecessary yet vital.  
Paralyzed by inaction.  

Every sound melding into one.  
Every alloy equally indiscernible.  
The bass resonating in a tense chest.  
The joy screeching in bleeding ears.  

Exhausting.  
Overwhelming.  
Disappointing.  
Repeated and forgotten and repeated.  

Is this friendship?  
Is this belonging?  
This is alien.
