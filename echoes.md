The words echo through my skull.  
No less clear than when they last held meaning.  
Paths in neurons that can't be unwalked.  
Through patches of moss that won't regrow.  
Without believing them I instinctually follow.  
As naturally as I breathe.  
Except I no longer need the oxygen.  
I am left haunted by the effortlessness.  

"I should really fucking kill myself."
