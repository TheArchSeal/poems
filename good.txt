empty, hollow, void and null
will it always be this dull
is there color, is it bright
was there ever even light
killing time as time kills me
lacking any will to be
there is no point to persist
i just hope i won't be missed

That was many years ago.
While some thoughts I can't forego.
Never thought I ever could.
It feels great to say I'm good.
