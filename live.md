# Then I Live

When the time has stopped advancing.  
When the world does not exist.  
When the self has ceased to matter.  
When the code is all that is.  
Then I live.  

When my hours pass in seconds.  
When my full surroundings stall.  
When my body is not present.  
When my program is it all.  
Then I live.  

When I can't feel night approaching.  
When I find no problems stick.  
When I do no longer hunger.  
When I only see logic.  
Then I live.  

\
\
\
\
Then I live.
