The illusion of anything's permanence  
is nothing but comforting lies.  
Eventually all will be rotten.  
Eventually everyone dies.  

With time, everything falters.  
The sturdiest object will rust.  
Nothing withstands decomposing.  
All will be turned into dust.  

But nature does not know regression,  
only the constant of change.  
As entropy keeps on increasing,  
chaos will never be strange.  

For passage of time means decaying.  
Necessarily everything fades.  
As the present continuously alters,  
the future already degrades.  

You too will be forever forgotten,  
a doomsday you cannot evade.  
But worry will not slow its progress.  
There is no reason to be afraid.
