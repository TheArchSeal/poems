flesh and bone or rigid stone
I know which I would choose
out of fragile temporality or endless modularity
I will gladly deal with screws

if bits and bytes would fill my veins
and copper was what my spine contains
if all my thought ran on silicon
while metal built my skeleton

though even steel will rust and fade
and computer systems still degrade
I think I would be happier
